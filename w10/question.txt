In a championship n (max 20) teams play for m (max 20) days. The outcome of the matches are stored
in a matrix of n Ã— m integers, each of which can only be either 0, 1 or 3. Each i-th row of the matrix 
represents the points acquired by the i-th team in the m days of the championship. Each j-th column 
of the matrix represents the points acquired by the n teams in the matches of the j-th day. The points 
acquired are 3 for a won game, 1 for tied and 0 for a defeat, respectively. 
Write a C function with the following prototype:
void displRanking(int C[MAXN][MAXM], int n, int m);
For each matchday of the championship, the function should print on the screen the index (i.e., the corresponding row number) of the team that is currently leading the championship (i.e., the team that has 
the highest sum of points since the beginning of the championship). In case there is more than one leading 
team, it should print the first that is found.
Example:
Given the following matrix with n=4 and m=3 
The outout should be:
The leading team in each of the 3 matchdays is: 0 0 3
