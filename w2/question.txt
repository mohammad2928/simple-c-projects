Write the function int charErase (char str[], int pos[]); that receives a string str and a 
vector of integers without repeated values pos and modifies the string str by deleting all the characters that are 
in the positions indicated by pos. The cancellation and compaction must be done directly on str. The vector 
pos has an unknown size, but it contains the value -1 as the last element. The function returns, as an integer, the 
number of deleted characters  
For example, if the string str is ThisIsAString and  pos contains  7,4,2,0,11,-1 the function should 
delete from str the characters S,I,i,T,n and return the value 5, modifying the string as follows:
