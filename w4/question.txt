Given two vectors of integers (either positive, negative or zeros) v1 and v2 of length d1 and d2 respectively, write 
a C function prodCartFilt that displays on the screen the cartesian product of the two vectors, filtered by
excluding the pairs of numbers that are either equal to each other or differ by 1. The prototype of the function 
should be the following:
void prodCartFilt(int *v1, int d1, int *v2, int d2) ;
Remember: the cartesian product of two sets of values is the set of all possible pairs combining one element of the 
first set and one element of the second set.
Example:
v1=(1,2,3) v2=(3,4,5,6) Filtered Cartesian product: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6).
The excluded pairs are: (2,3), (3,3), (3,4).
