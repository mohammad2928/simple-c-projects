Given a square matrix N x N, with N odd (N <= MAXN, with MAXN constant), write a function with the following 
prototype:
nt sumFrames(int mat[MAXN][MAXN], int N, int vet[]);i
The function stores in the vector vet, which is assumed to be of sufficient size to contain the result, the sum of 
the elements of each concentric frame of the matrix. The function should return the number of frames as an integer 
value.
As an example, the following 5x5 matrix is characterized by the presence of 3 frames (white, light gray, dark gray), 
one of which (the dark grey one) consists of the only central element of the matrix.
