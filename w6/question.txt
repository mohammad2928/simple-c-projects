Given two vectors of integers (either positive, negative or zeros) v1 and v2 of length d1 and d2 respectively, write 
a function prodCartOrd that prints on the screen the cartesian product of the two vectors, sorted by increasing 
sum of the elements of each pair (remember: the cartesian product of two sets of values is the set of all possible 
pairs combining one element of the first set and one element of the second set). The prototype should be as 
follows:
void prodCartOrd(int *v1, int d1, int *v2, int d2) ;
Example:
If v1=(2,1,3) v2=(4,5,3,6), the sorted cartesian product should be: (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (1,5), (3,3), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), 
(3,4) (2,6), (3,5), (3,6).
