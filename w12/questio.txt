Consider a square region in the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane whose bottom left and upper right 
corners have coordinates (0,0) and (100,100), respectively. A text file contains a sequence of rectangles, 
one per line, with sides parallel to the Cartesian axes. Each rectangle is identified by the x and y 
coordinates of the bottom left and upper right corners, reported with spaces as separators. The coordinates 
are integers between 0 and 100, with extremes included. Write the function int areaTot (FILE * 
fp); which receives as a parameter a pointer to the file (already open) and returns the total area covered 
by the rectangles. In case of intersection of rectangles, the area of the intersecting region should be
counted only once.
Example (for the sake of simplicity, we report a smaller region with x and y coordinates in the interval 
0..10)
If you assume that the file of the example contains 1 2 4 4 on the first line (see black rectangle) and 3 3 
5 8 in the second line (see grey rectangle), the total area returned by the function should be 15.
