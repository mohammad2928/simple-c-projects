Given a matrix of characters A of size n × m and a string s, write a C function that counts how many times the 
string is contained in the rows and columns of the matrix and returns the result in the form of an integer value. The 
string should be considered either horizontally from left to right or vertically from top to bottom. The prototype of 
the function should be:
int count(char A[][MAXM], int n, int m, char str[]);
Example: the string “cat” is contained 3 times in the following 4x5 matrix (see second column, fourth column 
and fourth row):
