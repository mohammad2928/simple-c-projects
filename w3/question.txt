Given a vector V of N integers. Write a C function that displays on the screen all the sub-vectors of maximum size 
that are made up of only contiguous cells with odd values. The function should have the following prototype: 
 
void maxOdd(int v[], int N); 
 
Example: given the array 1,3,7,1,0,1,9,3,1,0 the sub-vectors of maximum size with only contiguous odd numbers 
are: 1,9,3,1 and 1,3,7,1
