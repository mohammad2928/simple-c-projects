Given a string S of characters, write a C function countAndPrint that prints on the screen all the substrings of 
n characters that contain 2 vowels (remember that in C there is no library function that determines whether a 
character is a consonant or a vowel, it must be implemented from scratch). The prototype should be the following:
void countAndPrint(char str[], int n);
Example: if S=”forExample” e n= 4, the substrings that are 4-characters long and contain 2 vowels are: “forE”, 
“orEx”, “rExa” and “Exam”.
